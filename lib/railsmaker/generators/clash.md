# Managing Generation Possibilities and Preventing Clashes

## Using an LLM for Generation Tasks

### Advantages
1. **Declarative Input**:
   - Provide the LLM with structured descriptions of generation possibilities and rules.
   - Example: A list of all generative components, constraints, and expected outputs.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - LLMs excel at reasoning about abstract rules and dynamically applying them.

3. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Identify potential conflicts or redundancies in generation rules.

4. **Prototyping**:
   - Quickly prototype or adjust generation logic.

### Challenges
1. **Complexity Management**:
   - LLMs require clear and complete context for handling interdependencies.

2. **Execution vs. Suggestion**:
   - LLMs are better suited for suggesting logic than enforcing it during execution.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Large-scale or multi-threaded tasks might need additional runtime systems for enforcement.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Unexpected edge cases might not be handled without explicit guidance.

## Approach
1. **Define Possibilities**:
   - List all generation possibilities, subsets, and rules in a structured format (e.g., JSON or YAML).

2. **Provide Constraints**:
   - Clearly explain rules such as:
     - "Ensure no file overwrites."
     - "Prevent duplicate database migrations."

3. **Use the LLM as Validator**:
   - Let the LLM validate plans or configurations rather than execute tasks.

4. **Combine with Existing Logic**:
   - Use the LLM for reasoning, but enforce constraints with programmatic checks.

## Example Configuration
```yaml
components:
  - name: "UI Generator"
    constraints: ["unique file names", "no duplicate routes"]
  - name: "Auth Generator"
    constraints: ["unique database migrations", "no conflicting routes"]
subsets:
  - set: ["UI Generator", "Auth Generator"]
    usage: "frontend"
```
